# Main Page

Welcome the main page of the documentation.

First of all, issues and PRs are welcome.

The documentation describes features supported by the extension.

The extension can function in one of two modes:

* [Legacy Mode](legacy_mode/main.md)
* [Rust Language Server Mode](rls_mode.md)

Each mode is described in detail on its own page.

Furthermore, the extension allows:

* [To execute one of built-in cargo command](cargo_command_execution.md)
* [To create a playground](playground_creation.md)
* [To make the extension format the active document after save](format_on_save.md)
* [To make the extension execute a cargo command after save](action_on_save.md)

Also it provides snippets and keybindings.

They are not described because you can see them on the extension's page in VSCode.
