`RLS` checks the project and shows diagnostics while you are typing.

You can see diagnostics in the Problems Panel.

You can hover on a diagnostics to see what the diagnostic is.

Executing a cargo command doesn't show any diagnostics.

It is intentional decision.

The reason is that there is no pretty way to hide a diagnostic after the diagnostic's cause is fixed.

It may confuse people.
