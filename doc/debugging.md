# Debugging Page

It's possible to debug Rust code using another extension,
[LLDB Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb).

Install it using
```
ext install vscode-lldb
```
Make sure that LLDB is installed on your system.

Afterwards set up the LLDB debugger as for an usual executable.
